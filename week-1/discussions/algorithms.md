# Algorithms Lecture
## Overview
An algorithm is a set of steps.  In CS, algorithms are used to process data and solve problems.  There is a large set of defined algorithms used for many common problems.  Working with algorithms involves:

* Understanding what algorthims exist, what problems these algorithms solve and how they relate to each other.
* Implementing algorithms in code.
* Using code that implements an algorithm.
* Choosing the correct algorithm to solve a problem.
* Understanding the complexity of an algoritm.
* Writing more efficient algoritms to solve problems.

## Process
* What problem are you trying to solve?  What does this algorithm do?
* Perform the algorithm on a simple set of data?
* Write psuedocode for the algorithm and use this to perform the algorithm.  Iterate until psuedocode matches action.
* Think about edge cases.  Create more test cases to find where your alogrithm fails.
* How complex is your algorithm?  How much time / memory does it take? What is the Big-O Complexity.
* How is this algorithm similar / different from other algorithms you know?
* Write code for your psuedocode

## Example - Binary Search
Work through the steps above for Binary Search.

## Interview Practice
The algorithm is (unfortunately IMO) a common form of interview question.  Here are a few tips for tackling the algorithm interview question.

* Know what you know - ask what you don't
  * Prepare for an interview by listing algorithms you know.  If you are asked to work on a different algorithm that you don't know - see if you can relate it to one you do.
* Clarify.  Build a test case.  Write out assumptions.
* Psuedocode first - get the logic down on paper.
* After code or psuedocode - look for edge cases.
