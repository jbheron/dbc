#### Weekend
- review week 1
- complete the [self assessment challenge](../../../../week-1-self-assessment-challenge/) (it should take about 30 minutes.  you should be very comfortable with these basics.)
- work on your [hash understanding](../week-1/discussions/data-structures)  (work in groups on the weekend!)
- review the challenges from wednesday.  are you comfortable with them?  do the [orange tree challenge](../../../../orange-tree-1-just-oranges-challenge) especially, there is a sequel to be done on monday)
- take the [competency assessment survey](http://goo.gl/ApN56z).  it can help you see where you need to focus!
- work on your [fundamentals!](../../../../phase-1-guide/tree/master/week-1/discussions)
  - that means READ EVERY FILE at the link above.  it's what's good for you.
  - it's even better if you PRACTICE ALL THE THINGS there.  also good for you.
  - it's even better still if you TEACH OTHERS WHAT YOU LEARNED afterwards.
  - i'm not YELLING, i'm just ENTHUSIASTIC!
- get some fresh air and relax, life is good

### Weekday Evenings - Guide Your Own Learning

All core (:anchor:) challenges from the day should be done.  Usually, there will be a mandatory additional elective of redoing solo or reviewing and refactoring
an :anchor: challenge **OR** completing a stretch (:rocket:) challenge.  The included reading is sometimes spread out over a day or two, and should be completed by the end of the week.


### themes

**learning: understanding our learning selves**
- learning signals
- conscious learning
- stories of learning
- effective reading

**technology: focus on self expression through code**
- pseudocode and diagraming
- data, decisions, loops, flow
- implementing algorithms
- measuring code performance
- writing assertions

**craftsmanship: focus on tools**
- effective searching
- the command line & REPL
- working with sublime
- working with git / github
- using the debugger gem

### discussions

- data, decisions, loops and flow
- understanding and using variable scoping
- reading errors and effective debugging
- advanced Ruby syntax and idioms
- brief introduction to algorithmic analysis and Big-O notation

### reading

[link to dropbox with reading content](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ldrnf12rpx78eye/Kb1a8z2LFx)

hints for speed:

- when reading
  - evaluate the book (authors, amazon reviews, etc)
  - scan the TOC for items of interest and general awareness
  - seek out and surf your curiosity
  - go for breadth over depth first, then commit to depth when value is obvious
  - assuming you find value, take high level notes and include text snippets and page numbers to help you revisit
- when watching videos
  - evaluate the video (authors, reviews, comments, views)
  - scan a TOC (if available) for items of interest and general awareness
  - look for speed controls (try 1.5x or 2x speed)
  - assuming you find value, take high level notes and include video timing to help you revisit


#### Ruby

- Eloquent Ruby
  - read part I (there are several chapters in part I)
- The Well Grounded Rubyist
- Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby
- Confident Ruby
- Humble Little Ruby Book

#### Algorithms

*NOTE, some of this content is very heavy on "the math".  if that makes you nervous just keep breathing and remember these people are humans, just like you, and at one time they worked very hard to understand some of the patterns of thought, speech and writing that look so easy for them now.*

the following are selected videos and chapters that should be maximally valuable with minimal mathy-madness

- [Plain English explanation of Big O notation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/487278/2836874)
- Stanford on Coursera - Algorithms: Design and Analysis ([part I](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/preview) & [part II](https://class.coursera.org/algo2-2012-001/lecture)) (video)
  - [why study algorithms? (4 mins)](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/20)
  - [about the course (17 mins)](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/21)
  - [guiding principles for analysis of algorithms (15 mins) ](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/4)
  - [intro to data structures (5 mins)](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/61)
- Algorithm Design Manual
  - read chapter 2, especially sections 2.2 and 2.3, and focus your energy on making sense of figures 2.3 and 2.4 to build an intuition for Big O notation
  - scan chapters 3 and 4 to develop context for data structures, sorting and searching
  - the intro chapter also has a couple of good stories
  - and of course you'll scan the entire TOC, right?
  - [link to supplemental videos and slides](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/)
  - [solutions to selected problems](http://nbl.cewit.stonybrook.edu:60128/mediawiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_%28Second_Edition%29)
- Algorithms in a Nutshell

#### Learning

- [Effect of Praise on Mindset](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTXrV0_3UjY) (video)
- Adaptive Motivation (article)
- Mindset by Carol Dweck
  - read the "adaptive motivation" article above before diving into this book, it's short and will give you a good overview
- Bene Brown on the power of vulnerability (video)
- get an overview of [Visible Learning](http://visible-learning.org/glossary/) by John Hattie
