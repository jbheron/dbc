##WHAT TO DO AT 6PM 

###1) **STOP**  
Spend the next 15 minutes (until 6:15) reflecting on the day:
- Share with your pair how the day was for you, emotionall, physically or mentally.
- Review the [challenge list](https://github.com/fiery-skippers-2014/phase-1-guide/tree/master/week-1) and remind yourself of the challenges and the learning competencies.  
- Share some "aha!" moments with your pair and take notes of them (making quick notes of them is important!).  

###2) Ask Yourself Some Reflection Questions
Spend another 5 minutes expoloring these questions to help decide next steps:
- Are you confident with the learning competencies for all the day's challenges?
- Are you learning with your pair?
- What is the best way for you to learn and retain most?

###3) Plan Your Evening Learning
Take the most suitable path:
- **Go solo** - review and redo or refactor a core challenge that helps cover a missing competency
- **Find a pair to review with** - redo/refactor with someone needing similar competency brushup
- **Forge on w/ your pair** - finish your cores and try a stretch challenge
- **Help others** - if you're done with your cores, try teaching some of the competencies to see if you really understand them!
- **Go solo with stretch** - if you prefer to work solo on a stretch challenge, finish the current core with your pair and go solo.
- **Pair and stretch** - finish your current core with your pair, and find a student ready to dive deeper into stretch challenges

Additional ways to distill your knowledge:
- Read the suggested materials or research online to specifically to learn about missing learning competencies.
- Write down your insights and learning, whether in a blog or in a personal journal.  Writing is an amazing way to reflect and distill knowledge.


###4) Late Night Reflection 
- Before you go to sleep, ask yourself: Did you assess yourself accurately?  Was your evening time spent wisely?  How could you have made your time more effective?

The skill of accurate self assessment is hugely important at DBC to ensure you are staying in your optimal learning zone.  This skill is absolutely mandatory to effectively work on a team, do contract work, or work on any sizeable software problem.


###5) Review the Weekly Learning Competencies
Every couple days, review the overall and weekly learning compentencies to get a bigger picture view on how you are progressing.

*  **Remember:** Know when to push past your limits and when to take care of yourself.  DBC is a marathon, not a sprint.  Eat good food, get good rest, take breaks, and hold your bar high!
