##Methodology for Pseudocode
- define input and output
- delineate the high level steps
- flesh out the lower level steps


###Difficulty finding an Abstract Solution?
- take a simple test case and solve for it
- take another simple case and solve for it
- can your test cases elucidate the abstract solution?
- update the psuedocode steps accordingly


##Hallmarks of Good Pseudocode
**English-like statements are used to precisely describe specific steps in the process**
Full sentences aren't necessary, but variable names are fine to use and should make sense.

**Contains clearly defined inputs and outputs**
Defining the given conditions and the ultimate result explicitly allows the steps of the process to be contextualized and more easily understood.

**Code-specific syntax is avoided and a more a abstract, higher level is adhered to**
The nuances of ruby should be avoided, but common programming shorthands are OK. If-then-else statements or loops are well known shorthands, as well as defining and passing parameters.

**Formatting that clearly displays larger steps and respective smaller steps**
A traditional outline is a good example of helpful formatting. It's best to use some convention to group statements (indention, begin/end, curly braces, etc), but don't obsess over small details like proper punctuation.

**Appropriate granularity and ease of conversion to code**
The attention to detail should ensure that problematic nuances of the code are addressed at the high level, and systemic problems can be tackled appropriately. This should be balanced with readability.

**Intention is emphasized over implementation**
Making the intent of the problem approach clear should be emphasized over the specifics of implementation in a target language. Try to keep the context of the problem in mind, with the goal and output clearly defined.
