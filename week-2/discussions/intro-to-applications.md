This week introduces you to basic application development using the object oriented programming [paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).

Make sure you reference previous reading on OOP to help you build the best possible application.  Here's a reminder: [refactoring](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring), [POODR](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ldrnf12rpx78eye/o5udQil5pr/books/Practical%20Object%20Oriented%20Design%20in%20Ruby.pdf) and related [github repo](https://github.com/skmetz/poodr), etc.

The process we'll use to build our first few applications is as follows:

1. feature-level design (10 mins)
2. object-level design (20 mins)
3. fully tested minimum viable product (60+ mins)
4. review 3-5 alumni solutions to the same problem (30 mins)
5. rebuild (60+ mins)

By the way, for step (4), if you don't find a `solutions` folder with sample solutions in any of the challenge repos, you should be able to use Socrates to find dozens of samples by submitting a blank solution to any particular challenge and clicking on the "recent attempts" tab that shows up on the page right after you submit.
