This morning we will introduce you to the basic concepts of relational database design.

- Part 1: One to one schema
- Part 2: One to many schema
- Part 3: Many to many schema
- Part 4: Many to many schema to database: build something useful

The first 3 parts above are a reasonable introduction to the different relationships you will think about when modeling using relational database management systems.  The 4th part asks you to build a program in Ruby that works with a database to manipulate data.
