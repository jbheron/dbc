### what is our working agreement?

[student handbook](student-handbook)

- we meet in the Cave every morning at 9 am sharp (except Fridays for check-ins)
- we suggest that our top priorities for this phase be to:
  - learn how to respond and communicate appropriately (re: error messages, challenges, self talk)
  - seek opportunities to help each other, grow stronger as individuals and grow closer as a tribe
  - learn how to express our ideas using software by reading and writing code and speaking to others about it
  - learn how to optimize our own learning

*we can modify this working agreement as we move along*

### how can i pair well with others?

consider the following recommended steps to get your pairing session off to a good start:

![establish a working agreement](http://f.cl.ly/items/0F2v1l1u1k2w2K290u35/Screen%20Shot%202014-01-27%20at%205.31.34%20PM.png "working agreements make pairing easy")


### what does our git workflow look like?

[there](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) [are](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows) [many](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) [different](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows) [workflows](http://randyfay.com/content/rebase-workflow-git) [available](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2429011/2836874) for you to consider when using git.  did you notice how many different links there were in the previous sentence?

here's the one we'll be using in phase 1:
